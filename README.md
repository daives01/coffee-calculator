# [coffee-calculator-daives01.vercel.app](Coffee Calculator)

This is just a fun weekend project I created to solve a real-world problem I experience: doing math while making coffee

## Tools

I'm using NextJS, [chakra-ui.com](Chakra UI), and deployed it for free with Vercel. [coolors.co](coolors.co) was really useful in creating a color palette.
