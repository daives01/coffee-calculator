#  [Coffee Calculator](https://coffee-calculator-daives01.vercel.app/)

This is just a fun weekend project I created to solve a real-world problem I experience: doing math while making coffee

## Tools

I'm using NextJS, [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) , and deployed it for free with Vercel. [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was really useful in creating a color palette.

Quincy Batchelar had a significant hand in the design of the site.
Youtuber [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) was the source of most of the recipes/techniques.
